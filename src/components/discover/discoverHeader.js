        Art is everywhere and always has been. It lines the walls of museums,
        buildings, and caves. It fills our halls and ears with sound and music.
        It captures the eye with beautiful movement and imagery. Art doesnâ€™t
        just express our passions and history; it defines, influences and shapes
        culture and civilization.
